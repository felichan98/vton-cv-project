\subsection{Pre-processing}
Our aim is to use pictures in non-optimal lighting and perspective conditions, so due to the fact that our training dateset (Dress-Code) is mainly composed of high quality professionaly taken images, we are trying to imitate this condition and apply some enhancement to the generic input picture. In particular we chose to use:

1. constrast stretching: it is a simple image enhancement technique that attempts to improve the contrast in an image by stretching the range of intensity values it contains to span a desired range of values. Table \ref{contr_stretch} depicts a sample.

2. Bilateral filtering: we attempt to remove the noise while preserving the sharpeness of the edges. Table \ref{contr_stretch} depicts a sample.

3. Background removal: as our dataset training images usually possess a plain and homogeneous background, in order to decrease variance between training and real-world images, and to decrease the computational training effort, we are comparing semantic backgroud removal using different kind of segmentation techniques. Since this procedure is applied to real-world images, we trained a network over a dataset named Tik-Tok dancing segmentation that we belived to have a more natural picture acquisition of body shapes. To perform the semantic segmentation we used U-Net network and, as of now, we have trained over 10 epochs as a trial. Table \ref{tiktok_dataset} depicts some results.
